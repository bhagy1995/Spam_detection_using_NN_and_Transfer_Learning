# Spam_detection_using_NN_and_Transfer_Learning

In this project, we will build a recurrent neural network to classify a SMS text message as "spam" or "not spam". In the process, you will learn how to,

- Clean and process text data for machine learning.
- Understand and implement a character-level recurrent neural network.
- Use torchtext to build recurrent neural network models. (LSTM model)
- Understand batching for a recurrent neural network, and use torchtext to implement RNN batching.
- Understand how transfer learning can be applied to NLP projects.

Summary of models:

- Built a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and character level Recurrent Neural Network to identify and differentiate spam messages; achieving a test accuracy of 95%
- Utilized ULMFiT library as transfer learning for language model and improved test accuracy to 98.86%.
